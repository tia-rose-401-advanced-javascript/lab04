<h2>6 Reasons for Pair Programming</h2> <li>Iterative loops</li> <li> Code reviews</li> <li> Fast feedback</li> <li> Error checking and linting</li> <li> These are software engineering practices that have proven to dramatically improve the quality of code developers produce</li> <li> What if you can could get all of this, instantaneously, while typing code line by line and character by character? You can, with pair programming, a technique common to many agile work environments</li> <li> More "two heads are better than one" than "stop reading over my shoulder," pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together</li> <li> At Code Fellows, pair programing is one way we foster a collaborative environment while developing key industry skills</li> <h2>How does pair programming work?</h2> <li>While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator</li> <li> The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard</li> <li> Handling the "mechanics" of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code</li> <li> The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer</li> <li> The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs</li> <li> The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code</li> <h2>Why pair program?</h2> <li>While learning to code, developers likely study several programming languages</li> <li> Similar to a foreign language class, there are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language</li> <li> Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary</li> <li> Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an id</li> <li> Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey</li> <li> Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves</li> <li> During a five-hour paired lab session, Code Fellows students work on all four of these language-specific skills</li> <li> The abilities they foster will serve them well in completing assignments, in their own communication and learning, in interviews, and in readiness for a job at a company that utilizes this agile practice</li> <h2>Wow, all that? Let’s take a look!</h2> <h3>1. Greater efficiency</h3> <li>It is a common misconception that pair programming takes a lot longer and is less efficient</li> <li> In reality, when two people focus on the same code base, it is easier to catch mistakes in the making</li> <li> Research indicates that pair programing takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging (let alone exposing users to a broken product)</li> <li> So, in the long-run, it’s often actually more efficient than two people working on separate features</li> <li> When coming up with ideas and discussing solutions out loud, two programmers may come to a solution faster than one programmer on their own</li> <li> Also, when the pair is stuck, both programmers can research the problem and reach a solution faster</li> <li> Researches also identified pairing enhances technical skills, team communication, and even enjoyability of coding in the workplace</li> <h3>2. Engaged collaboration</h3> <li>When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone</li> <li> It is harder to procrastinate or get off track when someone else is relying on you to complete the work</li> <li> Popping open your Facebook timeline is just that less enticing when someone else is looking at your screen</li> <li> Another important aspect of learning to program is knowing when to ask for help</li> <li> We advise our students to spend no more than fifteen minutes stuck on a problem before asking a teaching assistant or instructor for help</li> <li> When developers pair program, they rely more on each other and can often find a solution together without needing to ask for additional help</li> <li> Ultimately, this boosts overall confidence</li> <h3>3. Learning from fellow students</h3> <li>Everyone has a different approach to problem solving; working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of</li> <li> If one developer has a unique approach to a specific problem, pair programming exposes the other developer to a new solution</li> <li> Often times, the developers in a pairing have different skill sets</li> <li> If one programmer is more experienced in a certain skill, they can teach a student who is less familiar with that area</li> <li> The less experienced developer benefits from the experienced developer’s knowledge and guidance, and the latter benefits from explaining the topic in their own words, further solidifying their own understanding</li> <h3>4. Social skills</h3> <li>Pair programming is great for improving social skills</li> <li> When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key</li> <li> This can become more difficult when two programmers have different personalities</li> <li> Pair programming not only improves programming skills, but can also help programmers develop their interpersonal skills</li> <li> When just grabbing the keyboard and taking over isn’t an option, getting good at finding the right words is a skill unto itself</li> <li> This has long-term career impacts</li> <li> As much as employers want strong programmers, they know it’s essential to hire people who can work well with others</li> <h3>5. Job interview readiness</h3> <li>A common step in many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant, either in person or through a shared screen</li> <li> They will carry out exercises together, such as code challenges, building a project or feature, or debugging an existing code base</li> <li> By doing so, companies can get a better feel for how an applicant will fit into the team and their collaboration style</li> <li> For most roles, the ability to work with and learn from others and stellar communication skills are as (or more!) important to a company than specific technical skills</li> <li> Pair programming strengthens all of those skills</li> <h3>6. Work environment readiness</h3> <li>Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product</li> <li> Code Fellows graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works can hit the ground running at a new job, with one less hurdle to overcome</li>
